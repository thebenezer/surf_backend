The country\'s appeal has much to do with its diverse scenery and rich cultural heritage. The best places to visit include everything from beautifully preserved country estates and castles, to its many world-class art galleries and museums.</p><br>\r\n<p>One of the greatest pleasures of a UK vacation, however, is just how easy it is to explore this fascinating and diverse country. Thanks to its size-the UK could easily fit into the state of Texas (with room to spare)-you can base yourself in cities such as London or Liverpool and simply take a train or bus to explore other areas.</p><br>\r\n<p>From the nation\'s capital, a 90-minute train ride is all it takes to access beautiful Salisbury, and a short bus ride or tour from here will take you to one of the country\'s most recognizable attractions, Stonehenge.</p>^\r\nStonehenge^\r\n<p>One of the planet\'s oldest World Heritage Sites, Stonehenge has been a place of pilgrimage for more than 4,500 years. It was believed to have been erected as a place of worship, but these days, the crowds consist of tourists drawn by the sheer scale of this magnificent monument to mankind\'s ingenuity.</p>^\r\nTower of London^\r\n<p>The centerpiece of this Thames-side fortress is the White Tower. Built in 1078 by William the Conqueror, it\'s home to amazing exhibits, such as Line of Kings, the world\'s oldest visitor attraction, established in 1652 with a remarkable display of royal armor.</p>^\r\nChester Zoo^\r\n<p>Located in Upton, just over a mile north of Chester city center, Chester Zoo is England\'s most visited attraction outside of London and is one of the best places to visit in England for families. The more than 11,000 animals living in this 125-acre site represent about 400 different species.</p>^\r\nCanterbury Cathedral^\r\n<p>Canterbury Cathedral is home to the Archbishop of Canterbury and is the cradle of English Christianity. It all started when St. Augustine converted the pagan Anglo Saxons here in 597 when he became the first bishop. Consider booking an overnight stay in the grounds at Canterbury Cathedral Lodge.</p>^\r\nEden Project^\r\n<p>The Eden Project is a collection of unique artificial biomes containing an amazing collection of plants from around the world. Located in a reclaimed quarry in Cornwall, this botanical gardens complex consists of huge domes that look rather like massive igloo-shaped greenhouses.</p>^\r\nScotland^\r\n<p>Think of Scotland, and you\'ll likely conjure up images of tartan-kilted Highlanders, skirling bagpipes, the Loch Ness Monster, lonely castles, golf, magnificent scenery, and shaggy Highland cattle. All of these are part of the mystique of this unique country, but also (apart from Nessie) a very real preview of what tourists see there.</p><br>\r\n<p>You can explore Scotland by boat, on foot along its trails, on scenic train rides, or touring by car, and each will lead to unforgettable experiences. History is everywhere as your sightseeing adventures take you to the castles and fabled battlefields where clans fought, see you trace the footsteps of legendary kings and queens.</p><br>\r\n<p>Another of Scotland\'s great attractions is its solitude, with its remote stretches of heather-covered moors; secluded beaches; and wild, romantic mountains, with their deep glens and lochs.</p>^\r\nLoch Ness^\r\n<p>Shrouded in myth and legend, Scotland\'s beautiful Loch Ness remains one of the country\'s top places to visit. Despite there being no definitive evidence that \"Nessie,\" the world\'s most famous sea monster, tourists try to spot the creature.</p>^\r\nKelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum^\r\n<p>Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum has become the primary destination for admirers of the Glasgow Style, a distinctive part of the Arts & Crafts movement and Art Nouveau styles of the early 20th century.

This European country is also filled with striking natural scenery and beauty, from the rugged Sierra Nevada mountain range to the white sand and blue lagoons of Mediterranean islands like Ibiza.</p><br>\r\n<p>The country is also fascinating due to the different cultures of its distinct regions. Many Spanish cities have ancient Roman ruins and Islamic architecture from the Moorish period, and medieval castles and fortifications along with Castilian- and Hapsburg-era palaces and mansions.</p><br>\r\n<p>Most also feature many examples of modern Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Modernist architecture. The country also represents the pinnacle in all things related to the sheer enjoyment of life: delicious food; great art; amazing music; lively dances; and warm, friendly people.</p>^\r\nThe Prado and Paseo del Artes^\r\n<p>The Prado alone ranks with the world\'s top art museums for the riches of its collections. But add the Reina Sofia National Art Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, and the CaixaForum, all along Madrid\'s mile-long, tree-shaded boulevard, and you have what may be the world\'s highest concentration of priceless art treasures.</p>^\r\nSeville Cathedral^\r\n<p>The Seville Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cathedral has more interior space than St. Peter\'s in Rome and a 37-meter main altar of carved statues completely covered in gold. The monumental tomb of Christopher Columbus is held aloft by a quartet of larger-than-life figures.</p>^\r\nGuggenheim Museum^\r\n<p>No photograph has ever done justice to this symphony of shapes, so alive that they seem ready to take wing. American architect Frank Gehry used blocks of limestone and undulating sheets of titanium to turn the notion of modern architecture on its ear. So thoroughly did he succeed that two new terms were born from it</p>^\r\nPlaza Mayor^\r\n<p>The throbbing heartbeat of Spain\'s vibrant capital city, Plaza Mayor has played an important part in Madrid life since the 16th century, when Philip II entrusted the task of designing it to his favorite architect Juan de Herrera, builder of the Escorial. It has served as the stage for ceremonial events.</p>^\r\nCosta del Sol Beaches^\r\n<p>Costa del Sol is the most developed part of the Coast. The Mediterranean water is warm and safe. Many towns have recently modernised \"paseo maritimos\". More jet skis per capita than anywhere else in Europe. No shortage of bars, restaurants and nightlife. Sand tends to be grey and coarse-grained.</p>^\r\nBarcelona^\r\n<p>The second largest city in Spain offers a completely different travel experience compared to Madrid. Its coastal location gives it more of a resort feel, complete with warm, sunny weather to enjoy on most days of the year. It\'s on the country\'s northeast coast, by the Mediterranean Sea, and also seems to have a much more modern, progressive vibe than Madrid and other Spanish cities.</p><br>\r\n<p>Must-see tourist attractions in Barcelona include the city\'s immense (and perpetually unfinished) Sagrada Familia modern cathedral and the Joan Miro museum, conceived by the iconic artist himself before his death. Other good places to see in Barcelona include the city\'s almost three miles of beaches and La Rambla, a huge, tree-lined, pedestrian-only street. It\'s where the entire city seems to come out for a stroll.</p><br>\r\n<p>Be sure to take the funicular (incline railway) up to the summit of Tibidabo, a local mountain with a beautiful church and amusement park at the top. You\'ll also be rewarded with spectacular views of the city and surrounding countryside.</p>^\r\nBasilica de la Sagrada Familia^\r\n<p>One of Europe\'s most unconventional churches, this spectacular basilica is the most famous sight in Barcelona. The UNESCO-listed Basilica de la Sagrada Familia stands in the northern part of the city, dominating its surroundings with its 18 spindly towers soaring high above all other monuments.</p>^\r\nLa Barceloneta^\r\n<p>Adjacent to the cruise port, the neighborhood of La Barceloneta borders the long, wide Sant Sebastià Beach, where locals go to sunbathe, surf, and socialize in the many seafood restaurants and tapas venues that overlook the sea.</p>^', 40.46, -3.75, 'spain_small.jpg', './assets/placeimages/spain/1.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/2.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/3.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/4.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/5.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/6.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/7.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/8.jpg^./assets/placeimages/spain/9.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small1.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small2.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small3.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small4.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small5.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small6.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small7.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/spain/small8.jpg^\r\n'),

To be sure you find the best places to visit and things to do, plan your itinerary using this list of the top attractions in Italy.</p>^\r\nCuisine^\r\n<p>Italian food is a surprisingly diverse cuisine. Each of the twenty Italian regions has a distinctive set of flavors, recipes, products, and ingredients. In fact, the Italian regions were not officially united as a nation until the mid-19th century; therefore, each individual region has retained much of its exclusive identity.</p>^\r\nColosseum^\r\n<p>This huge amphitheater, the largest of its kind ever built by the Roman Empire and the largest of their constructions to survive, remained a model for sports facilities right up to modern times. Built by Vespasian in AD 72 and enlarged by the addition of a fourth story by his son, Titus, it was a venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles.</p>^\r\nFlorence Duomo Santa Maria del Fiore^\r\n<p>The cathedral was built between the 13th and 15th centuries, with the most famous piece being the extraordinary dome, completed by Filippo Brunelleschi in 1434. Designed by Giotto, the campanile stands 82 meters tall, and you can climb the 414 steps up to a viewing platform with fantastic views of the city and the dome.</p>^\r\nPompeii and Mount Vesuvius^\r\n<p>The still smoking volcano of Mt. Vesuvius looks down on the remains of the city it destroyed in AD 79. But that same eruption also preserved many of the city\'s art treasures: frescoes, mosaics, and sculptures that were encased in the lava as it cooled. Visitors can still ascend to the very rim of still-active Vesuvius.</p>^\r\nLake Como^\r\n<p>Lake Como is one of Italy\'s most scenic areas, surrounded by mountains and lined by small picturesque towns. A haunt of the wealthy since Roman times, the lake has many opulent villas and palaces along its wooded shores; Villa Balbianello and Villa Carlotta are the best known, both surrounded by gardens that are open to the public.</p>^\r\nVatican City^\r\n<p>Since 1929, when the Pope reached a deal with Mussolini, the Vatican has been an independent state, the world\'s smallest with only 0.44 square kilometers. But within its walls are enough attractions and things to do to keep tourists busy for several days</p><br>\r\n<p> The two must-see sights are St. Peter\'s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, but the Vatican Palace contains magnificent rooms decorated by the greatest artists of their time, as well as priceless collections in more than a dozen museums. In addition to the major museums, smaller collections will appeal to specialized interests: the Museum of Secular Art\'s ancient sculpture, the Museum of Sacred Art\'s finds from catacombs and early Christian churches.</p><br>\r\n<p>The Map Gallery, a gallery of candelabras and tapestries, also holds objects brought back by missionaries, Papal carriages, vintage cars, and a collection of more than 800 works of modern religious art by Matisse, Dali, Munch, Rouault, and others.</p><br>^\r\nSt. Peter\'s Basilica^\r\n<p>The centerpiece of the Vatican and one of the best places to visit, the magnificent St. Peter\'s Basilica was built between the 16th and 18th centuries, replacing earlier structures that began in 326 on what is thought to be where St. Peter was buried.</p>^\r\nPantheon^\r\n<p>The Pantheon, an exceptionally well preserved remnant from Roman times, reveals the incredible architectural achievements of the Roman Empire. Disused after early Christian kings forbade use of a pagan temple as a church, it was later consecrated by the Pope in AD 609.</p>^\r\n', 41.87, 12.56, 'italy_small.jpg', './assets/placeimages/italy/1.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/2.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/3.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/4.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/5.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/6.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/7.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/8.jpg^./assets/placeimages/italy/9.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small1.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small2.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small3.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small4.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small5.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small6.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small7.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/italy/small8.jpg^'),

From cheap neighborhood shops to Michelin-starred restaurants, the quality and taste of food in Japan is of an incredibly high standard.</p>^\r\nWildlife^\r\n<p>Despite the country’s large human population, the land mammals of Japan are relatively numerous in the remote, heavily forested mountain regions. These animals include bears, wild boars, raccoon dogs, antelope, hares, and weasels.</p>^\r\nImperial Palace^\r\n<p>The chief attraction of Tokyo\'s Marunouchi district is the Imperial Palace with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats.

It was used in the Second World War and there is even a tunnel from here which tacks three kilometres to Parai which is on the coast.</p>^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            ', -0.79, 113.92, 'indonesia_small.jpg', './assets/placeimages/indonesia/1.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/2.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/3.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/4.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/5.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/6.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/7.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/8.jpg^./assets/placeimages/indonesia/9.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small1.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small2.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small3.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small4.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small5.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small6.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small7.jpg^\r\n./assets/placeimages/indonesia/small8.jpg^');
