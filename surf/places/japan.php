                                of awe-inspiring.
                                From cheap neighborhood shops to Michelin-starred restaurants, the quality and taste of
                                food in Japan is of an incredibly high standard.

                                beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats.
                                Still in use by the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace stands on the site where, in
                                1457, the Feudal Lord Ota Dokan built the first fortress.

                            <h1>Tokyo</h1>
                            <p>Tokyo is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. The Izu and Ogasawara
                                Islands are also part of Tokyo.
                                Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo
                                became Japan's political center in 1603.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and
                                dining to its visitors.
                                The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent
                                museums, historic temples and gardens.
                                Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in
                                the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.</p>

                                It was founded in 1920 as a way to honor the death of the Emperor who was responsible

                            <p>Kyoto (also Kyōto) is former capital of Japan and for more than a thousand years the
                                center of traditional Japanese culture.
                                Located in west-central Honshu, in the picturesque valley of the Kamo River with
                                surrounding mountains, it is one of the most historic and attractive of the world's
                                cities.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Kyoto has several hundred Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, a castle, three palaces,
                                beautiful parks and gardens, numerous museums, and more than 30 colleges and
                                universities.
                                <br>
                                Kyoto also has many picturesque and historically interesting sites in the environs.
                                These include Arashiyama with its river and temples, the tea-growing district around
                                Uji,
                                Mt. Hiei with the historic Enryaku Monastery, and Lake Biwa with its beautiful views.
                                <br>
                                The outlying Katsura Villa, also built in the 17th century, is regarded as the
                                masterpiece of Japanese domestic architecture. Modern Western architects, such as
                                Wright,
                                Taut, Gropius, and Le Corbusier, have made pilgrimages to view it and have pronounced it
                                one of the great architectural jewels of the world.
