                            <p>Eating plays an important role in Turkish peoples' lives. Especially dinner is a social occasion where all family members enjoy being together and have a chat. The oldest member starts the meal, others are to follow and so show their respect. Everybody must be considerate and respectful.<br>
                            If the meal is served on a single plate instead of individual plates, members are supposed to eat just what they have in front of them. There are irreplaceable favorites in the Turkish cuisine, such as:<br>
                            i)baklava<br>
                            ii)simit<br>
                            iii)kunefe<br>

                            <h1>Istanbul</h1>
                            <p> Lying on the banks of the Bosphorus, Istanbul is a city that is thousands of years old, and that originally was known as Byzantium, and later, Constantinople, before adopting the name Istanbul in the early 20th century.<br>
                            In Istanbul, you will find that architecture, culture, and trade routes converge from all over the world to make a wonderful melting pot that is really exhilarating
    
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The architecture in Istanbul is truly wonderful, and you can see a range of different influences and styles, from the Byzantine Hagia Sofia (that is over 1,400 years old), to the Romanesque Galata Tower.<br>
                            Istanbul is also the original home of the tulip, and the Sultanahmet Park and Emirgan Park are great places to see vast numbers of flowers in bloom between March and May.
                            </p>

Indifferent to a world where the maxim "nothing endures but change" is the norm, the village not only retained its historical features and cultural values, but also kept its natural beauty intact, and therefore, rightfully deserves to be called the "living Ottoman village"

                            <p>Cappadocia is a geological oddity of honeycombed hills and towering boulders of otherworldly beauty. The fantastical topography is matched by the human history here. People have long utilised the region's soft stone, seeking shelter underground and leaving the countryside scattered with fascinating cavern architecture. The fresco-adorned rock-cut churches of Göreme Open-Air Museum and the subterranean refuges of Derinkuyu and Kaymaklı are the most famous sights, while simply bedding down in one of Cappadocia's cave hotels is an experience in 21st-century cave living.

A single entrance, lit by the morning sun, opens onto three large interconnecting chambers. Although the little museum at the entrance displays some of its finds, most of the artefacts discovered are housed in museums around Turkey, with some of them dating to 160,000 BC.

Located on the historic Silk Road, the city has been a melting-pot of religions, languages and cultures for centuries. It played an important role in history due to its harbour and vital position on the legendary Silk Road.

The best place to start your excursion in the park is at Çukurbağ. One of the highest peaks is Demirkazık. The Bolkar Mountains are also popular for trekking and skiing with their karstic forms and glacier lakes. Located 80km from Niğde is Narlıgöl, a beautiful tectonic lake with fairy chimneys and rock-cut dwellings along its shore
