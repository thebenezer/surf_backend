                        <li>Online directory distributors when they list us in the directory may link to our Web site in the same
                            manner as they hyperlink to the Web sites of other listed businesses; and</li>

                to link); (b)the organization does not have an unsatisfactory record with us; (c) the benefit to us from
                the visibility associated with the hyperlink outweighs the absence of Surf; and (d) where the
                link is in the context of general resource information or is otherwise consistent with editorial content
                in a newsletter or similar product furthering the mission of the organization.</p>

                <p>These organizations may link to our home page, to publications or to other Web site information so long as
                the link: (a) is not in any way misleading; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval
                of the linking party and it products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's
                site.</p>
